# Kohonen
C Jerker Bjorkqvist 2001-2022

This is a demonstrator of a Kohonen network, developed during a course on neural networks in 2001.

The idea is to train a Kohonen network based on grayscake 64x64 picture information, into  a N x M grid of trained images. 
Then, a test image can be input and the Kohonen network shows the most similar from the trained set.

The software us done using wxWidgets cross-platform tools, hence it can be compiled and run on the plaforms wxWdigets support
